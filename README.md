# Predicting-House-Prices
A python project in which I use Linear Regression to predict house prices on California Housing Dataset

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Linear Regression model using the California Housing dataset from Scikit-Learn. The dataset provides information about various housing features and median house values, allowing us to predict house prices based on given features.

## Dataset
The California Housing dataset contains:

8 numerical features describing different aspects of California districts, such as:

- MedInc - Median income in the district

- HouseAge - Average age of houses in the district

- AveRooms - Average number of rooms per household

- AveBedrms - Average number of bedrooms per household

- Population - Population of the district

- AveOccup - Average number of people per household

- Latitude - Latitude of the district

- Longitude - Longitude of the district

- A target variable (MedHouseVal) representing the median house value in $100,000s.

##  Project Workflow
- Data Loading & Exploration â€“ Understanding dataset structure.
- Preprocessing â€“ Handling missing values, feature scaling, and splitting into train/test sets.
- Model Training â€“ Using Linear Regression to fit the dataset.
- Evaluation â€“ Analyzing model performance with metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score.
- Visualization â€“ Plotting feature relationships and regression results.

ðŸ“ˆ Expected Results
- Model performance metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and RÂ² Score.
- Insights into feature importance and regression coefficients.

ðŸ”® Future Improvements
- Experiment with Ridge and Lasso regression for better regularization.
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.
- Feature engineering to improve prediction accuracy.

Performance is measured using Mean Squared Error (MSE), which quantifies the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.

# Future Improvements
- Feature scaling and normalization to improve predictions.

- Experimenting with polynomial regression or other machine learning models.

- Hyperparameter tuning and feature selection to enhance model performance.
